# NetCDF data, time series and first raster

Before you start: download and unzip the ERA5 data from moodle. You can find a directory there with all data we will need. Also the WDI data was added there.

Also start a project and act accordingly with the ideas we learned last time.

Todays topics:

* Recap: Projects and RMarkdown
* Understanding NetCDF
* Using temperature data

## Topic Overview

Today we want to continue to explore ways to communicate findings from scientific results. We already started with Projects and did first experiments. Today we want to continue with everything and get deeper understanding.

## General Raster Graphics

* *Matrix* explicit in space.
* Each entry of the *matrix* is a *cell*.
* Each *cell* has a location in space and a size.
* The smaller the pixel, the higher the resolution.
* Rasters are usually regularly spaced in their coordinate system (this may also
  depend on the projection).

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:9, 3)
image(x)
```

## Data Cubes

* a geographical raster image includes the world map
* higher resolution increases data size
* not just images, but also time series per pixel are common (4D Cubes)
* Data Cubes (speciality of Leipzig: RSC4Earth)

**Exercise**

* How big is a raster, which covers the entire world with a resolution of 0.01 degrees and holds 64 bits of data in each pixel?
* Discuss: pivot tables vs. rasters

### NetCDF Files

* Network Common Data Form
* a de facto standard for raster data in the geographical context
* includes data, description, axes and more
* usually axes with longitude, latitude, time
* fill values and missing values

Alternatives:

* Zarr format (this is the future)
* GeoTIFF (easy to manage)
* HDF images (proprietary)
* GRIB (mainly used in meteorology)
* and more or less specialized ones

From NetCDF you can extract the axis data with the following commands. Don't forget to load the `ncdf4` library and use the correct path. We will later also need the `tidyverse` library

```{r, results = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(ncdf4)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
t2m_nc <- nc_open("data/era5_temperature2m.nc")
t2m_nc
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
t2m_nc <- nc_open("../data/era5_temperature2m.nc")
t2m_nc
```

because the date information is tricky to work with, we will have several different time axes to model our data accordingly and at the same time have the chance to create nice plots.

```{r}
t2m_nc_lon <- ncvar_get(t2m_nc, "longitude")
t2m_nc_lat <- ncvar_get(t2m_nc, "latitude")
t2m_nc_time <- ncvar_get(t2m_nc, "time")
t2m_nc_tax <- as.Date(t2m_nc_time / 24, origin = "1900-01-01 00:00:00.0")
head(t2m_nc_tax)
```

We will also create an index variable for the time. You will understand why we need it later.

```{r}
t2m_nc_idx <- seq_along(t2m_nc_tax)
```

So before we go into the map data more concentrated, let's have a look at some of the time series. To load a specific location you need the correct location as an index. Remember: The data has a spatial resolution of 0.25

```{r}
t2m_nc_lat[300]
t2m_nc_lon[300]
```

**Exercise**

* Write a function, which gives you the index to the closest value of a latitude coordinate. Example: `getLatIdx(2.77)` delivers `350`
* Tip for rounding: `round(2.77*4)/4`
* Tip for searching for the index: `which(t2m_nc_lat == 2.75)`
* Write a function which gives you the indices of specific coordinates of lat and lon coordinates. Example: `getLonLan(2.77, 13.95)` delivers the array `(57, 350)`

## Time series modeling

To get a time series at a location with the index we need to access the netcdf file:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
temperature <- ncvar_get(t2m_nc, "t2m",
  start = c(LONGITUDE, LATITUDE, 1, TIME_START_IDX),
  dcount = c(1, 1, 1, TIME_END_IDX)) - 273.15
```
```{r}
temperature <- ncvar_get(t2m_nc, "t2m",
  start = c(300, 300, 1, 1),
  count = c(1, 1, 1, 504)) - 273.15
```

**Exercise**

* What does the factor `- 273.15` mean?
* We want to find out about the temperature time series on a location on earth. Pick a location, find out about the coordinates and get the according indices. Check if you are still on land and not above water (The data there has more quality)
* Create a tibble with the variables temperature, time_index and time_tax (Don't forget to load tidyverse)
* use `ggplot` to plot the time series and add a linear model

Here is an example output:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
temperature <- ncvar_get(t2m_nc, "t2m", start=c(689,235,1,1), count=c(1,1,1,504)) - 273.15
t2m <- tibble(`idx` = t2m_nc_idx, `date` = t2m_nc_tax, `temperature` = temperature)
gg <- t2m %>% drop_na %>% ggplot
gg <- gg+aes(x=`date`, y=`temperature`)+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method=lm)
gg <- gg +
  ggtitle("Temperature in Marrakesch with linear trend") +
  xlab("Date") +
  ylab("Temperature in [Â°C]")
gg
```

## ERA 5 Data on the world map

To finally work with raster data, we want to extract a whole raster instead of a single time series. for this we will simply extract the whole map and only one time step. We will learn about the `ggplot` possibilities and rasters more detailed next time.

```{r}
t2m_data <- ncvar_get(t2m_nc, "t2m",
  start=c(1,1,1,1),
  count=c(1440,720,1,1)) - 273.15
image(t2m_data)
```

**Exercise**

* As you see the plot is upside down. Use different indexing to turn it around and plot it with `image`
* Write a function which returns the index of a specific date in the format "YYY-MM-DD" in the t2m_tax. Return `NA`, if it is not present in the data.
* Write a function which returns the temperature world map for a specific monthly date using the function above
* Add nice comments and tidy up everything in your R Project. We will extend it next time
