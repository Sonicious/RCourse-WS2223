# Data Exploring and Plotting II

Todays topics:

* Recap of pivoting and data exploration
* Plotting WDI data with polygons

## Topic Overview

Today we want to dig deeper into the general topic of exploration of data which is the combination of transforming data and visualize them.

![](data-science-explore.png)

We want to work with the WDI data again and plot them on a world map. Therefore please load the data as we did in the last class. We will need `wdi_data`, `wdi_country` and `wdi_series`. Please load the according tidyverse package as well.
Also note the `mutate` lines, which removes columns which were added through parsing errors.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
filename = "../Data/WDI_csv.zip"
wdi_data <- 
  filename %>%
  unz("WDIData.csv" ) %>%
  read_csv %>%
  mutate(...67 = NULL)
wdi_country <- 
  filename %>%
  unz("WDICountry.csv" ) %>%
  read_csv %>%
  mutate(...31 = NULL)
wdi_series <- 
  filename %>%
  unz("WDISeries.csv" ) %>%
  read_csv %>%
  mutate(...21 = NULL)
```

## Recap: Transform and Manage data

It is important to understand the tables before working with them. Therefore we have a look at all columns:

```{r}
colnames(wdi_data)
```

To properly pivot the data into any dimension, we first make one long table. Moving into this direction is called `pivoting longer` in R.

```{r}
wdi_data_piv_long <- wdi_data %>%
  pivot_longer(`1960`:`2021`,
               names_to = "Year",
               values_drop_na = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))
```

Dimensions of the data: Country, Indicator, Year

To pivot wide again, `pivot_wider` gives the possibility to extend the table again according to the data. In our case we are mainly interested to access the data by country and year.

```{r}
wdi_data_piv <- wdi_data_piv_long %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = c("Country Code", "Year"), names_from = "Indicator Code")
```

This pivoted data is now tidy for exploration and plotting. First we want to find a nice indicator in the data to dive deeper into.

```{r}
print(wdi_data %>%
  select(`Indicator Code`, `Indicator Name`) %>%
  filter(str_detect(`Indicator Name`, "CO2 emissions")), n=30)
```

To get along better with such big tables which are about exploring, sometimes it's easier to organise descriptions. Even better is a full description from `wdi_series`. here we have to merge the tables before. Because there is no full description for every Code, we will use a left join. We will save the data in case we want to look at it from another program.

```{r}
description1 <- wdi_data %>% select(`Indicator Code`, `Indicator Name`) %>% unique
description2 <- wdi_series %>% select(`Series Code`, `Long definition`) %>% unique
description <- left_join(description1, description2, by = c("Indicator Code" = "Series Code"))
write_csv(description, "DataDescription.csv")
```

Now we can explore the description table easier and look for CO2 emissions in kt:

```{r}
description %>%
  filter(str_detect(`Indicator Name`, "CO2 emissions")&str_detect(`Indicator Name`, "kt"))
```


We are interested in total CO2 emissions in kt. Therefore we will pick the first entry save the according code:

```{r}
chosenCode <- description %>%
  filter(str_detect(`Indicator Name`, "CO2 emissions")&str_detect(`Indicator Name`, "kt")) %>%
  select(`Indicator Code`) %>%
  .[[1,1]]
```

The saved code `r chosenCode` we now use to get more information

```{r}
description %>%
  filter(`Indicator Code` == chosenCode) %>%
  select(`Long definition`) %>%
  .[[1]]
```

We can also explore the pivot table in detail now:

```{r}
wdi_data_piv %>%
  filter(`Country Code` == "DEU") %>%
  select(`Country Code`, Year, chosenCode)
```

Sometimes it is easier for further plotting to rename the axes:

```{r}
wdi_data_piv %>%
  filter(`Country Code` == "DEU") %>%
  select(Year, chosenCode) %>%
  rename("Value" = chosenCode)
```


### Exercise

Explore the data find a time series which is interesting to you. Plot the time series and annotate the axes.

```{r}
wdi_data_piv %>%
  filter(`Country Code` == "DEU") %>%
  select(Year, chosenCode) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  rename("Value" = chosenCode) %>%
  ggplot +
  aes(x = Year, y = Value) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "CO emissions in kt") +
  labs(title = "CO 2 emissions in Germany")
```
An alternative is to use `.data[[chosenCode]]` in `aes` except of renaming:
```{r}
wdi_data_piv %>%
  filter(`Country Code` == "DEU") %>%
  select(Year, chosenCode) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  ggplot +
  aes(x = Year, y = .data[[chosenCode]]) + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "CO emissions in kt") +
  labs(title = "CO 2 emissions in Germany")
```



## Plotting on map: Polygons

Next to the table data is would be nice to get a broader overview. For this we will need the following library loads:

```{r}
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
```

Here we will load the according positions of countries.

```{r}
countries_sf <- ne_countries(returnclass = "sf")
```

The `sf` data is a kind of data.frame with specific annotations to plot features of countries. This enables the possibility to plot the world map with the countries.

```{r}
countries_sf %>% ggplot + geom_sf()
```

To plot the WDI data into this map, we will have a look at the `wdi_countries` data more detailed. It is suitable to merge the data from the table to the `wdi_data` pivot table along the country codes.

```{r}
colnames(wdi_country)
```

```{r}
wdi_data_extra <- wdi_country %>%
  select(`Country Code`, `Short Name`, Region, `Income Group`,
         `System of trade`, `Government Accounting concept`) %>%
  full_join(wdi_data_piv, by="Country Code")
```

To plot these data according with the `sf_countries`, we need to add the pivot table as features to the `countries_sf` data. We will use an `inner_join` to be sure there will be no wrong data. For pure overviews and to grab a genereal idea of the data and plots, this is absolutely ok. If you want to publish articles, you should be more specific here.

```{r}
wdi_data_extra_sf <- inner_join(countries_sf, wdi_data_extra,
                                by = c("iso_a3" = "Country Code"))
```

The final data `wdi_data_extra_sf` is the final result for data wrangling and ready to plot all kinds of features on a world map:

```{r}
wdi_data_extra_sf %>%
  filter(Year == 2010) %>%
  ggplot +
  aes(fill = .data[[chosenCode]]) +
  geom_sf()
```

### Exercises

* read the help page `?dplyr::join`. What are the differences between `full_join`, `inner_join`, etc.
* `mutate` also supports creating and modifying columns. Calculate the nuclear and renewable power consumption per capita in 2019. Save the values in a new column and create a map from the results. Hint: Electric power consumption per capita and percentage of nuclear/renewable electricity.
* You have seen `group_by` and `summarize` in the `iris` example. Calculate the mean per capita income per region and decade. Hint: Adjusted net national income per capita, How can you get the decade programatically?

```{r, include = FALSE}
# maps:
wdi_data_extra_sf %>%
  mutate(nucl_pcap = EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC * EG.ELC.NUCL.ZS / 100) %>%
  filter(Year == 2019) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(fill = nucl_pcap) %>%
  geom_sf()

wdi_data_extra_sf %>%
  mutate(rnew_pcap = EG.USE.ELEC.KH.PC * EG.ELC.RNEW.ZS / 100) %>%
  filter(Year == 2019) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(fill = rnew_pcap) %>%
  geom_sf()

# income calculations:
description %>%
    filter(str_detect(`Indicator Name`, "Adjusted net national income per capita")) %>% .[3,]
IncomeCode <- description %>%
    filter(str_detect(`Indicator Name`, "Adjusted net national income per capita")) %>% .[[3,1]]
wdi_data_extra %>% 
  select("Region", "Year", .data[[IncomeCode]]) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Region`)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(.data[[IncomeCode]])) %>%
  mutate(Decade = floor(Year/10)*10) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Region`)) %>%
  group_by(Region, Decade) %>% 
  summarise(Income = mean(.data[[IncomeCode]], na.rm = TRUE))
```
