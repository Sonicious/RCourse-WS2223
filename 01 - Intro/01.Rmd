# The *read evaluate print loop* (REPL)

```{r prompt = TRUE, comment = ""}
""
```

`>` is the *prompt* and indicates that `R` is waiting for your input.

On the sheets/slides we don't prepend code with `>` and prepend output with `##`, this
makes you able to copy/paste code to your REPL.

```{r}
""
```

# R as a calculator

```{r, eval = FALSE}
1 + 1
cos(2 * pi)
sum(1:5)
pi
(3 + 4) * 3
3 + 4 * 3 # where is the difference?
-2 ^ 2
0 ^ 0
1 / 0   # not an error!
5 %/% 2 # integer division
5 %% 2  # 5 mod 2
TRUE & FALSE   # and
TRUE && FALSE
TRUE | FALSE  # or
TRUE || FALSE
!TRUE         # not
3 == 3  # relational tests
3 != 3
3 > 5
2 <= 4
7 >= 5
```

# Variables

Assignment operator: `<-`, use **Alt -** in R Studio

```{r}
age_years <- 3
age_days <- age_years * 365
age_days

sentence <- "hello world"
sentence
ls() # list all variables

rm("age_days") # remove variable
ls()

rm(list = ls()) # clear workspace
```

**Exercise**:

  * Calculate `age_hours`, `age_minutes`, `age_seconds`, assign a variable
  * Create a Variable `me` with your name

# Data types
`mode` gives you the according datatype of something
```{r}
mode(49)
mode(1 + 1i)
mode("Hello world")
mode(TRUE)
mode(sum)
mode(list(1, 2, 3))
```
you can use `'...'` or `"..."` to delimit strings. It makes no difference

There are some more modes but these are not important for us (There is also
`typeof`, `storage.mode`, and `class`).

# Vectors
in `R` **everything** is a vector!, create a vector with `c(e1, e2, e3, ...)`

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
print(a)
b <- 1:4
print(b)
d <- c("yes","no","maybe", 4, TRUE, a)
print(d)
x <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 11) # creating a sequence
print(x)
```

## Indexing vectors
Indexing is done using `[`, see also `help("[")`

Extract elements/subset by position
```{r}
x <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 11)
x # the entire vector
x[] # the entire vector
x[1] # extract a single element
x[c(1, 3)] # subset
x[1:3] # sequential subset
```

## Working with vectors
Try to find out what happens in the according lines
```{r, eval = TRUE}
cc <- seq(1, 0, length.out = 6)
cc
sort(cc)
order(cc)
cc[order(cc)]
rev(cc)
```

```{r}
length(cc)
mean(cc)
sum(cc)
```

Exercise: Calculate the sum of all entire numbers from 1 to 100.

## Assignment of vectors
```{r}
x
x[1] <- 5
x[4] <- 6
x[5:6] <- 10
x
x[x < 0.3] <- -999
```

## Named vectors
The elements of a vector can also be named.
```{r}
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
x
names(x) <- c("c", "d", "e") # add or modify names
x
names(x) <- NULL # remove names
x
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
x["a"] # indexing
```

Be aware of mixing named and unnamed vectoring:
```{r}
x <- 1:4
x["a"] <- 999
x
```
**But!**
```{r}
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
x[1] <- 999
x
```

## Vector arithmetics
```{r}
x <- 1:6
x + 1
x * 2
sqrt(x) # square root
sum(x) # sum of elements
prod(x) # product of elements
c(2, 2) * c(4, 5) # element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product)
```

**Exercise**:

  * What `mode` are the elements of `d <- c("yes","no","maybe", 4, TRUE, a)`? Why?
  * What is happening here? Try to interprete
  ```
  x <- 1:6
  x + 1:2 # recycling
  x + 1:4 # recycling
  ```
  * Calculate:
    * $4\cdot\left(\begin{matrix}2\\ 3\\ \end{matrix}\right)$
    * $\pmatrix{27\\64} + \pmatrix{14\\16}$
  * calculate the scalar product of $\pmatrix{1\\1\\2}$ and $\begin{pmatrix}4\\2\\3\end{pmatrix}$. How can you realize it in a simple form with the known commands?
  * `rnorm(n)` gives a vector with a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 of length n, how to get a normal distribution centered around 5 and standard deviation 0.5?

# Matrices

A matrix is the 2 dimensional equivalent of a vector.
```{r}
matrix(1:9, 3, 3)
matrix(1:12, 3, 4)
matrix(1:12, ncol = 3, nrow = 4)
matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 2), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
matrix(c("a", "b", "c", "d"), 2, 2)
```

## Indexing matrices
`[` can have as many arguments as there are dimensions (and more named arguments)

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:9, 3, 3)
x[2] # index as if it was a vector
x[1, 2] # rows, columns
x[1:2, 1:2] # submatrix
x[c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2)]  # index several elements at once
x[1, ] # one row as vector
x[, 1] # one column as vector
x[1, , drop = FALSE] # one row as submatrix
x[, 1, drop = FALSE] # one column as submatrix
```
Not setting `drop = TRUE` by default is one of the biggest errors of the makers
of `R`.

**Exercise**:

  * try and interprete:
    * `matrix(1:9, 3, 3) + c(1, 2, 3)`
  * What happens here? `matrix(1:12, ncol = 3, nrow = 4) + c(1, 2, 3)`
    * Tip: try `1:12+c(1, 2, 3)` as comparison
  * Perform some calculations with the matrix-product: `%*%`
    * e.g.: `matrix(1:4,2,2) %*% matrix(5:8,2,2)`
    * what is the difference of a matrix product of vectors and the scalar product in R?

# Arrays
Vectors: 1 dimension, Matrix: 2 dimensions, Arrays: n dimensions
```{r}
array(1:8, dim = c(2, 2, 2))
```

## Indexing arrays

Works exactly like indexing `matrix` but with more arguments.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
x <- array(1:27, dim = c(3, 3, 3))
x[1:3] # index as a vector
x[1:2, 1:2, 1:2] # subarray
x[1, , ] # submatrix
x[1, , , drop = FALSE] # subarray
x[1, 1, ] # subvector
matrix(c(1, 1, 1,
              2, 2, 2),
            ncol = 3,
            byrow = TRUE)
```
**Exercise**:

  * Name 2 examples, where such high dimensional arrays could be useful.

# Lists

Vectors, matrices, arrays: **all elements have the same type!** (Also they are called fields sometimes)

List: each element can be any R object.

An unnamed list:
```{r}
list(1, "a", 1:2)
```

A named list:
```{r}
list(a = 1:3, b = letters[1:5], c = sum)
```

Named matrices need lists
```{r}
y <- matrix(1:4, 2, 2, dimnames = list(c("r1", "r2"), c("c1", "c2")))
y
y["r1", "c2"]
```

**Exercise**:

  * What is `letters` and `LETTERS`? Try to find out.

## Named lists

```{r}
x <- list(a = 1, b = 1:3, c = "a")
x$a # element
x[["a"]] # element
x["a"] # subset
x[c("a", "b")] # subset
```

## Assignment of lists
```{r}
x <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
x$d <- 4
x[["e"]] <- 5
x$a <- NULL # delete element
x[["b"]] <- NULL
x
```

# Logical indexing
```{r}
x <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 11)
x < 0.5 # works elementwise
x[x < 0.5]

y <- matrix(1:9, 3, 3)
lower.tri(y)
y[lower.tri(y)]
```

# Packages

You can install new packages with
`install.packages(package_name)`
(packages should be installed in the pool already)

Install the following packages:

* `ggplot2`
* `dplyr`
* `data.table`
* `raster`
* `xlsx`

Alternative: Use the *Packages* tab in RStudio

Load a package by using:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

# Data frames
## Spreadsheets in R

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(species = c("A", "A", "B", "C", "A"),
                  density = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7),
                  count = c(24, 20, 18, 3, 10))
```

* Standard way of storing data (Also in Matlab, Python, Julia, ...).
* A set of lists where each element is a vector with the same length.
* Each column can have a different type

```{r}
summary(df1) # statistical values
str(df1) # some peek into the dataset
```

## Data frames indexing
### Subsetting columns

```{r}
df1$species
df1[["species"]]
df1[, "species"]
```
```{r}
df1["species"]
```

### Subsetting rows

```{r}
df1[df1$species == "A", ]
df1[df1$species == "F", ]
df1[df1$count == 10, "species"]
```

## datasets
One of the most important datasets for simple tasks is the iris dataset.

![image of the flowers](iris-machinelearning.png)

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(iris)
iris
```
